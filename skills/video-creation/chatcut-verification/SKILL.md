# Verification

Use both structural and visual evidence when the requested result is visible:

1. Re-read the affected project scope with `read_project`, `browse_assets`, or targeted item/asset detail. Use the latest response for ids, tracks, timing, and readiness.
2. Inspect composed timeline frames through the visual tool exposed by the current manifest. Successful rendering or mutation metadata is not visual proof until the returned pixels are inspected.

Use local source bytes for raw source understanding when the original path is available. Use `inspect_asset` when the original is not locally available. Source frames help select moments but do not prove timeline composition; use composed timeline frames for trims, layers, captions, effects, crops, transitions, and Motion Graphics.

If signed frame URLs are returned and the host cannot inspect them directly, download the complete shell-quoted URLs into a temporary directory and inspect those files. Do not report visual success from URLs alone.

If visual proof is blocked by upload/readiness or renderer state, report the blocker explicitly and ask the user to inspect the live editor when appropriate. Never convert a failed verification into an unsupported tool fallback or a false completion claim.
